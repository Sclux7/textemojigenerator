## generate text emojis with a list of symbols!

## what it does
So basically you generate text emojis with symbols from a list of symbols for the eyes and a list of symbols for the mouth.
Examples!
( 〜꒦ ✿ )
(0~ ☀)
(ᕗ꒦ ')
( 〜 - " )
(- ✿ 〜)
( ✿ ↖ ● )
(ˋ̠ ꒦-)
( ೭ ↙■ )
( ೭ ←◐ )

At the moment they are a bit rough around the edges, but keep ~~gambling~~ and they might look really awesome!

## future additions
I might add accessory slots for the emojis like this example:
